Challenge for Insight Data Science

# Problem
Generate a list of all drugs, the total number of UNIQUE individuals who prescribed the medication, and the total drug cost, which must be listed in descending order based on the total drug cost and if there is a tie, drug name.

# Input Dataset

The original dataset was obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services but has been cleaned and simplified to match the scope of the coding challenge. It provides information on prescription drugs prescribed by individual physicians and other health care providers. The dataset identifies prescribers by their ID, last name, and first name. It also describes the specific prescriptions that were dispensed at their direction, listed by drug name and the cost of the medication.

# Approach
Approach for this problem is as :

Drugs Dictionary:
Created a dictionary of unique drugs as the keys from the text file.

Values for Drugs:
Created a set of unique users who took the drug and the total cost of the drug.
